Contact Manager is a web application built with ASP.NET Core that allows users to manage their contacts. Users can create, edit, delete, and search contacts, each associated with a category, phone number, email address, and optional group memberships or notes. The application enforces unique constraints on phone numbers and email addresses to prevent duplicates across contacts.

Create Contacts: Add new contacts with a name, category, phone number, and email address.

Edit Contacts: Update existing contact details.

Delete Contacts: Remove contacts from the database.

Search Contacts: Search contacts by name, phone number, or email address.

Unique Constraints: Phone numbers and email addresses must be unique across all contacts.

Categories: Assign contacts to categories (e.g., Family, Friends).

Notifications: Display success/info messages for user actions (e.g., "Contact created successfully").

Responsive UI: Basic Bootstrap-based UI for a clean user experience.


Technologies Used:

ASP.NET Core 8.0: Web framework for building the application.

Entity Framework Core: ORM for database operations.

MySQL: Database for storing contact data.

Bootstrap: Front-end framework for styling.


Razor Pages: For rendering views in MVC.
